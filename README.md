# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This is a web-based sorting visualizer using JS and CSS with React libraries. All the animations of the bars is implemented through CSS style sheets.

The visualizer has 6 sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. Hope you having fun messing with different speed and size settings and getting to see algorithms in action.
